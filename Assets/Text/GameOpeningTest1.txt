We Need to Talk

[[Raymond, Rodrigo, why don't we start with you telling me why you're both here?|Ray explains why they're here.]]




:: Synergy
Rod: Our powers depend on each other to be effective.  I can absorb energy...

Ray: ... and I can discharge it.  Seperately, we're not nearly as great as we are together.

[[I see. Tell me more about your work together.|Ambition two sides]]


:: Fully endorse Rod's POV [Ambition Rod]
Ray:  Hmph.  Well, if you really think so, I guess I'm just being selfish.  I guess I can be more responsible.

[[Great!  I think we're making some progress here.  Now what else would you like to talk about| Amb resolved]]


:: Ambition Rod's side
Rod: Well, I already told you about how Ray takes too many risks.  When we started working together, I knew that he was in it for the glory, but I didn't realize how irresponsible he could be.  I just wish he would behave more conscientiously.

[[I think you're totally right, Rod.  Ray should be more responsable.|Fully endorse Rod's POV]]
[[I think you make some good points there, but I'd also like to hear what Ray has to say.|Ambition Ray's side now]]

[[I don't know about that.  It sounds like Ray really wants to advance his career and can't afford to be held back.|Disagree with Rod]]


:: Ambition
Ray: Well, this is a big part of why we came here.  We work together prefessionally, and we don't want a messy break-up to interfere with that.

[[Would it be possible for you to work seperately?|Synergy]]
[[Tell me more about your work together.|Ambition two sides]]

:: Disrespect. [disrespect]
Rod: Ugh.

Ray: Wow, some "professional" you are.

[[Oh, sorry about that.  Why don't you tell me more about your problems, Ray.|Ray explains the problem.]]
[[Oh, sorry about that.  Rod, you've been awfully quiet.|Rod is private, disrespect.]]


:: Ray explains why they're here.
Ray:  We’ve been together for a while now, like 15 years, but we’ve decided we want to break up.  It just isn’t working for us as a romantic relationship.  But we are also in a business partnership that we want to maintain.

[[Tell me more, Ray.|Ray explains the problem.]]
[[Rod, you've been awfully quiet.|Rod is private.]]
[[Boy, golly!  You guys are superheroes! What are your superpowers?|Disrespect.]]


:: Disagree with Rod
Ray:  Ever since I was little, I've wanted to be a leader.  Someone people look up to.  And our work is a way for me to achieve that.  But Rod is just so restrictive!  He won't let me be the best that I can be.  I want him to give me a little leeway every once in a while.

[[That sounds reasonable.  Rod, I think you should let Ray have some more freedom.|Fully endorse Ray's POV]]
[[Hmm, maybe we should come back to this problem later.|Fail to resolve]]


:: Ambition Ray's side now
Ray:  Ever since I was little, I've wanted to be a leader.  Someone people look up to.  And our work is a way for me to achieve that.  But Rod is just so restrictive!  He won't let me be the best that I can be.  I want him to give me a little leeway every once in a while.

[[I think you have both made some good points.  Ray, I think you should be more conscientious when Rod tells you to take care.  And Rod, Ray's career is very important to him, and you should be more supportive of that.|Agree with Both]]
[[That sounds reasonable.  Rod, I think you should let Ray have some more freedom.|Fully endorse Ray's POV]]


:: Ambition two sides
Ray: In the hero scene it's all about glory.  You want to be on the top, and we've got what it takes to be there.  If only *he* would step up his game and back off mine.

Rod: Not exactly.  Ray is a loose cannon.  Without me keeping him in check, he'd self-desruct.  I'm worried that one of these days he's gonna get someone hurt.

[[For the moment, let's focus on Ray's vision for your partnership.|Ambition Ray's side]]
[[For the moment, let's focus on Rod's concerns about the potential risks in your line of work.|Ambition Rod's side]]


:: Agree with Both [Ambition Win]
Ray: I suppose I have been a bit irresponsable.  After all, this isn't about just us, is it?

Rod:  And I should be more sensitive about what you want and ease up a bit.  Within reason, of course.

[[Great!  I think we're making some progress here.  Now what else would you like to talk about| Amb resolved]]


:: Fail to resolve



:: Ray, what do you think about that? Disrespect.
Ray: What can I say?  He's a stick-in-the-mud.

[[What would you say to that, Rod?|Rod is private, disrespect.]]



:: Rod is private, disrespect.
Rod:  I prefer to keep my private life private.

[[Ray, what do you think about that?|Ray, what do you think about that? Disrespect.]]
[[Rod, this is a safe space.  Anything you say here stays here.|Safe space. Disrespect.]]
[[Well, Rod, you are going to have to open up in order to solve your problem here.|Ray explains the problem.]]




:: Ray explains the problem.
Ray: Oh, where do I even start?  Rod is always bringing me down!  He holds us both back professionally.  We could be cruising with the big dogs if he wasn't so timid.  He's also a huge cheapskate!  I can't spend a cent without him freaking out.  Honestly, I think he's just jealous of me.

:: Safe space. Disrespect.
Rod: Yeah, I know this is *supposed* to be a safe space.

[[Well, Rod, you are going to have to open up in order to solve your problem.|Ray explains the problem.]]
[[Alright, can you both explain what the issue is?|Ray explains the problem.]]



:: Safe space.
Rod: Yeah, I know this is supposed to be a safe space.

[[I can certainly see why that might be frustrating.  Rod, what do you think about all of this?|Ambition Rod's now]]
[[Hmm, I think what Rod said about responsability is right.  You should be more careful, even if it is detrimental to your career.|Disagree with Ray]]


:: Fully endorse Ray's POV [Ambition Ray]
Rod:  Maybe?  I guess I can cut Ray some slack when it comes to taking risks.

Rod:  Ok, well, I guess I can start then.  For me, I just feel like Ray lives in his own little world.  He doesn't consider the consequences of his actions.

Ray:  Well, Rod is always bringing me down!  He holds us both back professionally.  We could be cruising with the big dogs if he wasn't so timid.  He's also a huge cheapskate!  I can't spend a cent without him freaking out.  Honestly, I think he's just jealous of me.

Rod:  I am not jealous of you!  And maybe I woulnd't get so upset about your spending if you helped out a little more around the house.

:: Money
Rod:  Well, money's kind of tight for us.  People don't really think about it, but you don't actually get paid for fighting crime, and it doesn't leave a whole lot of time for better paying jobs.  The thing is, Ray spends like he has all the money in the world!

Ray:  Hey, wait a minute.  I may spend a bit more than you.  But, one, this look doesn't maintain itself, and two, he only spends so little because he happens to actually like living like the Amish.
