Therapist:  Tell me why you are both here.
Ray:  We’ve been together for like 15 years as a couple, and we’ve decided we want to break up.  It just isn’t working for us as a romantic relationship.  But we are also in partnership in business that we want to maintain.  But we don’t see a path for that and need your help.
